# Fabio's Portfolio

## [A silly genetic algorithm](https://github.com/FabioNicotra/FabiosPortfolio/blob/main/01_GeneticAlgorithm/GeneticAlgorithm.ipynb)

The project was originally assigned during the course Data Structures in Python held by Politecnico di Torino in cooperation with Reply IT.
This notebook presents two distinct implementations of a genetic algorithm. The first implementation utilizes simple functions to handle a list of floats, where each float represents the fitness of an individual.
The second implementation takes advantage of object-oriented programming principles. Here, each individual is represented as an object with its own attributes. A dedicated class is responsible for managing the population, utilizing its methods to execute iterations of the evolutionary process. By encapsulating the individuals within objects, this object-oriented approach offers improved modularity, reusability, and ease of implementation.

## [Mobile price classification](https://github.com/FabioNicotra/fabionicotra.github.io/blob/main/02_MobileClassification/MobileClassification.ipynb)
The project was originally assigned during the course Data Structures in Python held by Politecnico di Torino in cooperation with Reply IT.
The dataset provided for this project contains information about technical characteristics of mobile phones as well as price ranges. The objective is to analyze the device characteristics and explore their influence on the device price.
Additionally, the project involves implementing different classification models. These models will be used to categorize the devices based on their features and predict their price ranges. The classification models aim to provide insights into how different device characteristics contribute to determining the price.
