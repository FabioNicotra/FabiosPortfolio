# Fabio's Portfolio

## [1. A silly genetic algorithm](https://github.com/FabioNicotra/FabiosPortfolio/blob/main/01_GeneticAlgorithm/GeneticAlgorithm.ipynb)

The project was originally assigned during the course Data Structures in Python held by Politecnico di Torino in cooperation with Reply IT.
This notebook presents two distinct implementations of a genetic algorithm. The first implementation utilizes simple functions to handle a list of floats, where each float represents the fitness of an individual.
The second implementation takes advantage of object-oriented programming principles. Here, each individual is represented as an object with its own attributes. A dedicated class is responsible for managing the population, utilizing its methods to execute iterations of the evolutionary process. The object-oriented approach offers improved modularity and ease of implementation.
