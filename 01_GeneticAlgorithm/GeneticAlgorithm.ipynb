        "In computer science and operations research, a genetic algorithm is a metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection. They are part of a larger families of algorithms known as evolutionary algorithms. Genetic algorithms rely on the existence of a candidates population that evolves in time, exploiting operators such as mutation, crossover and selection, in order to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "Genetic algorithms *optimize*, i.e., they select the best solution according to given criteria from a set of available alternatives. They efficiently search the solution space thoroughly enough to avoid picking a good answer when a better one is available. They do not perform exhaustive searches of the space, since they don't try every possible solution. They continuously grade solutions and then use them to make choices going forward.\n",
        "\n",
        "Genetic algorithms use a *fitness function* to preserve/discard candidates in a population, and then build the next iteration of such a population according to context rules.\n",

        "The basic process is as follows:\n",
        "1. Randomly generate a population of solutions\n",
        "2. Measure the fitness of each solution\n",
        "3. Select the best solutions and discard the rest\n",
        "4. Cross over elements in the best solutions to make new solutions\n",
        "5. Mutate a small number of elements in the solutions by changing their value\n",
        "6. Return to step 2 and repeat until converge or halt condition.\n",

        "Let's say for the sake of simplicity that our population has a 50/50 male/female ratio. At each iteration crossover happens, generating new offspring. Most likely the new offspring present the same characteristics of their parents, so we apply mutation to a very limited number of them. Before moving on, we resize our population in order to keep only the smartest individuals. We make sure to keep the same initial gender ratio and the same number of initial individuals.
