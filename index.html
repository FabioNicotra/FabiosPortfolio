          Modern Portfolio Theory: comparison of expected and realized
          performances
        </h2>
        <p>
          The aim of the present project is to compare the expected returns of
          different portfolios, assessed using Modern Portfolio Theory, with
          their realized performance. The analysis focuses on 5 of the major
          Italian stocks. Historical data from 2011 to 2020 is utilized to
          determine expected returns and volatility. Successively, different
          portfolios are constructed at the beginning of 2021, using prior
          knowledge to forecast their performances. Finally, historical data
          from 2021 to the present day is used to benchmark the results of the
          analysis.

        <h2>A simple genetic algorithm</h2>
        <p>
          The project was originally assigned during the course Data Structures
          in Python held by Politecnico di Torino in cooperation with Reply IT.
          This notebook presents two distinct implementations of a genetic
          algorithm. The first implementation utilizes simple functions to
          handle a list of floats, where each float represents the fitness of an
          individual. The second implementation takes advantage of
          object-oriented programming principles. Here, each individual is
          represented as an object with its own attributes. A dedicated class is
          responsible for managing the population, utilizing its methods to
          execute iterations of the evolutionary process. By encapsulating the
          individuals within objects, this object-oriented approach offers
          improved modularity, reusability, and ease of implementation.

        <h2>Mobile price classification</h2>
        <p>
          The project was originally assigned during the course Data Structures
          in Python held by Politecnico di Torino in cooperation with Reply IT.
          The dataset provided for this project contains information about
          technical characteristics of mobile phones as well as price ranges.
          The objective is to analyze the device characteristics and explore
          their influence on the device price. Additionally, the project
          involves implementing different classification models. These models
          will be used to categorize the devices based on their features and
          predict their price ranges. The classification models aim to provide
          insights into how different device characteristics contribute to
          determining the price.
