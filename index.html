          The aim of the present project is to compare the expected returns of
          different portfolios, assessed using Modern Portfolio Theory, with
          their realized performance. The analysis focuses on 5 of the major
          Italian stocks. Historical data from 2011 to 2020 is utilized to
          determine expected returns and volatility. Successively, different
          portfolios are constructed at the beginning of 2021, using prior
          knowledge to forecast their performances. Finally, historical data
          from 2021 to the present day is used to benchmark the results of the
          analysis.

            The project was originally assigned during the course Data
            Structures in Python held by Politecnico di Torino in cooperation
            with Reply IT. This notebook presents two distinct implementations
            of a genetic algorithm. The first implementation utilizes simple
            functions to handle a list of floats, where each float represents
            the fitness of an individual. The second implementation takes
            advantage of object-oriented programming principles. Here, each
            individual is represented as an object with its own attributes. A
            dedicated class is responsible for managing the population,
            utilizing its methods to execute iterations of the evolutionary
            process. By encapsulating the individuals within objects, this
            object-oriented approach offers improved modularity, reusability,
            and ease of implementation.

            The project was originally assigned during the course Data
            Structures in Python held by Politecnico di Torino in cooperation
            with Reply IT. The dataset provided for this project contains
            information about technical characteristics of mobile phones as well
            as price ranges. The objective is to analyze the device
            characteristics and explore their influence on the device price.
            Additionally, the project involves implementing different
            classification models. These models will be used to categorize the
            devices based on their features and predict their price ranges. The
            classification models aim to provide insights into how different
            device characteristics contribute to determining the price.
